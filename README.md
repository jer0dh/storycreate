This is a simple idea of letting mulitple people write a story together; much like one does over a camp fire.

This is probably poor code as I am using this idea and project as a learning tool.

Uses Angular.js
Have also php files for restful connection to mySQL database
   .htaccess file pointing to the php files
   RewriteRule ^api/story /story2/sql/restful/storyManager.php [L]
   RewriteRule ^api/user /story2/sql/restful/userManager.php [L]
